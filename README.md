# Recall Guard üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüîÜ

This is a web application called 'Recall Guard', it aims to streamline the identification and removal of recalled medical products, ensuring timely compliance and safeguard patient well-being.

Recall Guard utilizes optical character recognition (OCR) technology to simplify the recall check process. Users can simply photograph a medical item's label; The application automatically extracts key identifying text and cross-references it in real-time with official regulatory databases (e.g., FDA, TGA) to instantly determine its recall status.
