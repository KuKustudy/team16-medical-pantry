This is a web application call 'Recall Guard', it aims to streamline the 
identification and removal of recalled medical products, ensuring timely 
compliance and safeguard patient well-being.

Recall Guard utilizes optical character recognition (OCR) technology to simplify
the recall check process. Users can simply photograph a medical item's label; 
the application automatically extracts key identifying text and cross-references
 it in real-time with official regulatory databases (e.g., FDA, TGA) to 
 instantly determine its recall status.

FDA: Food & Drug Administration, an United State organisation, their website 
can be accessed on https://www.fda.gov/

TGA: Therapeutic Goods Administration, Australian Government agency, their
website can be accessed on https://www.tga.gov.au/
